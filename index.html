              <p>Prophets both today and in the scriptures consantly talk of the gathering of Israel. But what is it and how do we participate in it?</p>
              <p>The gathering of Israel is a combination of personal conversion of Christ as well as helping others come unto Him. It is centered on making and keeping covenants with God. To fully understand the gathering, we must understand the history of Israel and how God has covenanted with them all thorughout time, including how he covenants with us today.</p>

                <p class="description">
                  Because of Abraham's righteousness, God made covenants with him that we now refer to as the Abrahamic covenant. Some of the promises that God made are found in the Pearl of Great Price such as:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="description">"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;
                  <br>And I will bless them through thy name; for as many as receive this Gospel shall be called after thy name, and shall be accounted thy seed, and shall rise up and bless thee, as their father;
                  <br>And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse them that curse thee; and in thee (that is, in thy Priesthood) and in thy seed (that is, thy Priesthood), for I give unto thee a promise that this right shall continue in thee, and in thy seed after thee (that is to say, the literal seed, or the seed of the body) shall all the families of the earth be blessed, even with the blessings of the Gospel, which are the blessings of salvation, even of life eternal."

                  <p class="description">
                  We know that God gave Jacob the name Israel and that Israel came to represent the posterity of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They were promised that as long as their posterity stayed true to their covenants, they would be blessed with all things promised to Abraham. However, they did not stay true and were in return scattered across the nations.

                <p>
                  <p class="description"> God attempts to gather Israel when He sent Moses to deliver the children of Israel from bondage.
                    The Jospeh Smith translation of the bible teaches: <br>
                    "And the Lord sware unto Joseph that he would preserve his seed forever, saying, I will raise up Moses, and a rod shall be in his hand, and he shall gather together my people"
                    <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/jst/jst-gen/50?lang=eng">(JST Genesis 50:34)</a>
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="description">
                  After Moses lead the Children of Israel from Egypt, he then brought them to Mount Sinai where 
                  "the Lord intended to sanctify them and renew with them the covenant he had made with their father Abraham. Having been so empowered, they were to return to the land the Lord had promised the seed of Abraham and there build a temple to their God."
                  <a href="https://rsc.byu.edu/vol-11-no-1-2010/gathering-israel">-Joseph Fielding McConkie</a>
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="description">
                  Joseph Fielding McConkie expounds on this saying:
                  "Sinai was the holy mount. It was the place where the children of Israel were to meet their God. It was the place where they were to enter into covenants with him. For all intent and purpose, Sinai would be Israel's first temple. To gather Israel was to lead them back to true temple worship."
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <p class="description">The fact that Moses was called to gather Israel is significant not only because he was called to do so in his days but he was also called to initiate the gathering in this last dispensation.</p>
                    <p>

                <p>
                  <p class="description">God once again stretched forth his hand to gather Israel in this last dispensation. 
                    After the Lord accepted the dedication of the Kirtland temple, Moses appeared to Jospeh Smith and Oliver Cowdrey. Joseph explains what happened:
                <br>
                  <p class="description">"The heavens were again opened unto us; and Moses appeared before us, and committed unto us the keys of the gathering of Israel from the four parts of the earth, and the leading of the ten tribes from the land of the north."
                  <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110?lang=eng">(D&C 110:11)</a></p>
                </p>
                <p>
                  <p class="description">The saints continued to build a city of zion by building a temple to endow themselves with power on high. They sent out missionaries first to england and then to other parts of the world. They went on what is called 
                    <a href="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/covenant-of-oliver-cowdery-and-others-17-october-1830/1">Lamanite mission</a> 
                    which was to preach the gospel to the Native Americans to fulfill the prophecy that the Lamanites would be preached too again. The Saints gathered first in Ohio, and then Missouri, and Nauvoo, before heading west to the Salt Lake Valley in hopes of finding a place that they could call Zion.</p>
                </p>
                <p class="description">More evidence that God is attempting to gather Israel in these latter days comes through the Book of Mormon. President Nelsons taught that "the Book of Mormon came forth as a sign that the Lord had commenced to gather children of the covenant."

                  Nephi says "These sayings shall come unto the Gentiles according to his word, then ye may know that the covenant which the Father hath made with the children of Israel, concerning their restoration to the lands of their inheritance, is already beginning to be fulfilled."

              <p class="description">Before helping to gather anyone else to Israel, you must first be gathered yourself.</p>
              <p class="description">"The gathering of Israel consists in believing and accepting and living in harmony with all that the Lord once offered his ancient chosen people. It consists of having faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, of repenting, of being baptized and receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and of keeping the commandments of God. It consists of believing the gospel, joining the Church and coming into the kingdom. It consists of receiving the holy priesthood, being endowed in holy places with power from on high, and receiving all the blessings of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, through the ordinance of celestial marriage. And it may also consist of assembling to an appointed place or land of worship"

However, becasue God loves all of his children, He allows us to do the work for those people so that they can enjoy the blessings that are promised through those covenants.</p>

                Temples are where we can make covenants and participate in ordinances that allow us the blessings that were promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. This is why it is so central to the Gospel that we should be working towards being and remaining worthy of the temple as well as helping others do the same (whether they be living or dead).
              </p>
              <p>
                "Gathering, in the highest sense of the word, means to receive the same temple blessings that Abraham received. Gathering to “lands” is primarily for the purpose of gathering to locations where we have or will build temples. As Joseph Smith said, the main object of gathering the people of god in any age to certain places is “to build unto the Lord a house whereby He could reveal unto His people the ordinances of His house and the glories of His kingdom, and teach the people the way of salvation."
                <br>"The gathering testifies of God’s plan. He does not gather all his children all the time, there are periods of time meant for the gathering of Israel and periods for the Gentiles, and there are periods of apostasy as prophesied, and all of this is in God’s plan. He knows the right time and means for sending the gospel to each of us. The temple is the great equalizer in this plan. Whether the time to hear the gospel is in this life or in the next, if it is accepted, the reward is the same, exaltation. Work for the dead in the temple makes that possible."

              We see the importance of temples in the drastic change in the amount of them being built in recent years. In the 5 years that President Nelson has been prophet, He has announced
              <a href="https://www.ldsliving.com/the-number-of-temples-in-africa-is-about-to-triple-here-are-15-other-temple-facts-and-stats-you-might-not-know/s/94164">133 temples.</a>
              This means that President Nelson has announced 44% of all temples!

              <p>President Nelson testifies that as we Let God Prevail in our lives and in doing so become part of the house of Israel, God will fight our battles, He will help us make decisions, He will love us and remember the covenants we have made with him. That we will be strengthened through temptation, find purpose and truth, and recognize our full potential. That we will truly see that God is a God of miralces.

                Because of their wickedness, the Children of Israel were scattered across the land and lost the knowledge of the covenants they had made.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                The scattering started when Assyria carried the 10 tribes into captivity.
                <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/17?lang=eng&id=6#p6">(2 Kings 17:6-7)</a>
              </p>
              <p>
                It continued when Babylon carried Judah away into captiviy.
                <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/ot/2-kgs/25?lang=eng&id=1,7,11#p1">(2 Kings 25)</a>

              <p>
                The Persians allows the Jews to return, only for them to be scattered again in AD 70 after the Romans took Jeruselem.

                Lehi contributed to the scattering when him and his family left Jeruselem.

              The articles of faith state that there will be a literal Gathering: 
              <br>“We believe in the literal gathering of Israel and in the restoration of the Ten Tribes."

              </p>
              <p>
              However, we are cautioned to not get caught up in that:
              <br>"The simple part of the gathering—that certain peoples gather to certain lands—can, if we are not careful, camouflage its deeper implications. The gospel principle of the gathering of Israel goes far beyond where we will live. Among other things, it teaches Latter-day Saints about their responsibilities in the Lord’s plan, and it emphasizes that exaltation requires temple ordinances."

             </p><p>
              We must focus on the spiritual gathering first:
             <br>"Both ancient and modern prophets, from Enoch to Joseph Smith, have foretold that the Lord’s covenant people would be gathered again in a future day—first spiritually and then temporally"
